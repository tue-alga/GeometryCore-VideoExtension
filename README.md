This is an extension to the GeometryCore library, functioning as a wrapper to 
make it easier to create videos within GeometryCore's rendering system.

It builds on jcodec (http://jcodec.org/, a standalone video encoder/decoder in
native Java) to do handle the actual encoding. It is currently built on version
0.2.3, later versions may or may not be supported depending on how jcodec 
develops. jcodec is licensed under BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License.
